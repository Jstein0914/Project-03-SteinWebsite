# Retrospective

## Reflection
This final project was a culmination of all I had learned in the class, from markdown creation to website design. In addition, this project allowed me to highlight my new skills as a project manager. From initial planning to final deployment each step was guided by the principles learned in the book, Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager, by Kogan and Blakemore.

## What Went Well
- **Documentation**: The scope document enabled me to clarify my objectives. The planning document served as a guide to ensure that all tasks were completed accurately and efficiently. Lastly, the retrospective document provided me an opportunity to evaluate outcomes and identify areas for future improvement.
- **Peer Review**: The peer review process was highly positive, with no recommendations for revisions. While I anticipated potential feedback for improvement, I appreciate the constructive and encouraging comments received regarding my work.
- **Website Creation**: Developing the website using Markdown and CSS proved to be a highly rewarding experience, and I took great satisfaction in completing the project.

## Challenges Faced
- **GitHub**: Developing and utilizing GitHub presented several challenges during the project. There were multiple unsuccessful attempts when creating the projectâ€™s repository. Further research and repeated efforts helped address these issues. As a result, I learned how to create and delete repositories in GitHub.
- **Time Constraints**: Although I developed a comprehensive plan.md outlining my responsibilities and detailing my risk assessment and mitigation strategies, I continued to experience some anxiety regarding meeting deadlines.

## Lessons Learned
- **Documentation is Key**: Preparing the scope, plan, and retrospective documents served not merely as a procedural requirement but also facilitated the clarification of objectives, monitoring of progress, and final outcomes. These deliverables contributed significantly to the project's professionalism and sense of direction.
- **Technical Persistence Pays Off**: GitHub presented early obstacles, but through trial, error, I gained confidence in managing repositories. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of version control.
- **Time Management Requires Flexibility**: Even with a solid plan, the timeline felt tight. I learned to prioritize tasks, accept my mistakes, and trust the process. This taught me a valuable lesson in balancing ambition with realism.
- **Feedback is Fuel, Even When Minimal**: While peer review offered no major revisions, the encouragement I received affirmed the clarity and quality of my work. It reminded me that leadership includes listening, even when the response is minimal.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, this project was a powerful exercise in project management, blending technical execution with thoughtful reflection. This project was more than a technical exercise; it was a chance for me to celebrate my success as a web designer. By applying project management principles, my project reflects both personal pride and professional growth. Every line of code written, every color choice decided upon, every correction made contributed to a website that felt meaningful and complete.
